    "description": "Bitcoin is the first decentralized cryptocoin ever built on top of a blockchain. It was created by an anonymous person or group of people with the nickname Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009 as an open source project.\n\nTo understand the Bitcoin blockchain we can imagine a book, where each page number contains a signature that can validate the content of that page and its previous one. This signature is computed by an algorithm known as SHA-256 and cannot be reversed. In other words we can calculate the A-256 signature from some content, but we can’t get content if we know its SHA-256 signature. Back to the example with the book: if we tear out a page from the book, we can easily understand that a page is missing. The same is with adding an inexistent page. All the pages are copied between members of the chain, and this is why the Bitcoin Blockchain is considered a distributed network.\n\nBitcoin is an open source project maintained by a developer team with over 580 active contributors. The code of the chain is available on Github. The main purpose of Bitcoin was decentralized but trusted, low fee money transactions between people and businesses around the world. Nowadays over 100.000 vendors accept Bitcoin for payments. And there are between 2.9 and 5.8 million unique users who actively use Bitcoin cryptocurrency wallets. The price of Bitcoin can be very volatile due to speculation and has changed in the past more than +/-20% during a single.",

It works very similar to Bitcoin and differs mainly in  parameters such as hashing algorithm (scrypt), coin supply limit (84 million) and average blocktime(2.5 minutes).\n\nLitecoin was launched in 2011 by former Google engineer Charlie Lee, in order to enable CPU mining at a time when GPUs took over as Bitcoin's primary mining driver. However people later managed to port Scrypt over to GPU as well as ASICs, yet tecoin has still managed to remain mostly in top 10 cyptocurrency list (ordered by market capitalization).",

    "description": "Dogecoin is a fun meme coin that was launched on December 6, 2013. The coin is a decentralized peer-to-peer currency that tried mimicking the popular Bitcoin, but in an an effort to surpass Bitcoin's popularity. Doge features a cartoon Japanese character Shiba Inu, that acts as the coin's mascot. The intention of this mascot is to show the fun part that this coin was intended to be. \n\nDogecoin's developer Billy Markus based this coin's code on Lucky coin, that is based on another coin called tecoin. Litecoin uses the scrypt technology in its proof-of-work consensus mechanism preventing dedicated Bitcoin miners from mining. It is for this reason that Dogecoin was at least originally effectively mined with ordinary PCs instead of the dedicated miners. \n\nWhile it was introduced as a fun coin, Dogecoin's community has since grown by a lot. It is now mainly used to tip social media users who contribute great and interesting content on various platforms. Instead of simply liking their content, the contributors get rewards in form of Dogecoins. It is also frequently used for raising funds for charity events, eg. in the case of the construction of a well in the Tana river delta in Kenya.\n\nApart from Billy Markus, who came up with the original idea, another key individual in the coin's development is Jackson Palmer of Adobe Systems. It is Palmer who took over this project and propelled it to its current status.",

Vertcoin is not controlled by large banks or mining hardware manufacturers and can be mined by anyone profitably. Fairly distributed without a premine, ICO or airdrop, Vertcoin is developed by community members working as volunteers and the project is wholly funded by donations. A finite resource similar to gold, you can rest assured that Vertcoin will keep your money safe from vested interests and ensure that transaction fees are proportionate and shared between a large number of miners. With Vertcoin, you can truly be your own bank.\n\nVertcoin’s algorithm is designed to resist the development of custom mining hardware and multipool mining, ensuring that transactions are validated by a widely distributed network and avoiding the selling pressure when large mining pools indiscriminately flood the market with freshly mined coins. Our developers have pledged to take whatever steps are necessary to protect this coin from specialized mining equipment and make sure that it will always be possible to mine with consumer grade hardware. This is great news for miners because it offers the opportunity for all miners to compete fairly with each other, and not have to risk falling victim to unscrupulous hardware manufacturers who may fail to deliver pre-ordered equipment.",

Digibyte's largest user-base is found in the Netherlands.\n\nWhile Digibyte shares a lot of functionality with Bitcoin, it has a few major differences. It has a very short blocktime of just 15 seconds (compared to Bitcoin's 10 minutes), thus allowing e transactions to go through the blockchain in any given timespan. Digibyte;s network doubles the number of transactions by halving the block time every 2 years. A unique feature of Digibyte is that Digibyte alternates between 5 different mining algorithms, namely (Scrypt, SHA256, Qubit, Skein or Groestl). Additionally Digibyte's supply limit is at 21 billion.",

One is the traditional cryptographic proof of work associated with digital currency. The other proof of work is a third-party verified meter reading representing 1 MWh of generated solar electricity. SolarCoin is equitably distributed using both of these proofs of work as a means to reward solar electricity production.\n\nSolarCoin can be claimed by individuals living in homes with solar panels on their roof or large solar electricity farms, whether leased or financed.\n\nSolarCoin will purchase orbital storage capacity on SpaceBelt storage to provide its customers with an inviolable record of their transactions.",

Farmers are responsible for storing, providing and manipulating data for users, and are rewarded with Safecoins for it.\n\nTo ensure privacy, data sent to the network is encrypted and divided into small pieces, which are sent to multiple \"vaults\" (farmer nodes). Therefore, a vast number of nodes are storing the same bit of data, ensuring it's never offline. Farmers must rst go through a proof-of-resource to check for bandwidth and hardware to run a vault.\n\nUnlike most cryptocurrencies, SAFE Network doesn't have a blockchain. They use \"XOR Networking\", which is a way of allocating a \"digital physical location\" to a vault. Each vault is \"XOR located\" and thus \"XOR distant\" from another. When data is uploaded to the Network, its split and distributed in a manner that they are kept by vaults close to each other. Close enough vaults always share much of the same copy of data pieces, and the probability of a data piece being stored by two vaults decrease as they distance. Vaults form groups and reach consensus among themselves. They also \"group sign\" actions that need to travel along the network (such as group forming, splitting or merging).\n\nNodes can become \"elder vaults\", able to vote (such for forming and splitting groups) and perform other special transactions. Elder vault status is reached as the node \"ages\" and by progressive proof-of-performance.",

Privacy is built in its design by default for all the network participants.&nbsp;The development is currently led by Riccardo Spagni with a few other core protocol developers after splitting from the original Bitmonero project (forked from bytecoin) in 2014.&nbsp;\n\nMonero has unbounded inflation, after emission of 18.132 million monero (May 2022), a constant tail emission of 0.6 XMR every 2 minutes will ck in resulting around 1% inflation per year. A permanent inflation keeps miners incentivized, thereby securing the network.\n\nMonero enables untraceable and unlinkable transactions. It uses Ring signatures to protect sender identity, stealth address to protect recipient identity and Ring CT (Ring confidential transaction) to protect transaction amount. This is vastly different from Bitcoin where all transactions are visible to everyone and a sophisticated blockchain analysis can potentially reveal a user's identity. Monero is currently working on Kouri to integrate I2P (The invisible internet project) to protect users IP address as well.\n\nIn April 2018, Monero made an effort (successful so far) to become ASIC resistance, in order to prevent mining centralization. Monero's privacy feature makes a true fungible coin. It also supports the concept of 'view key'. Using a 'view key' a user can share transaction details with a third party or an auditor. No one can spend coins using 'view key'.\n\nGovernments are usually not greats fans of the anonymous cryptocurrency concept. Notably, the Japanese Financial Security Agency is already trying to ban such coins, as they worry that they can be used for illegal activities. However, Monero's community is strong and supportive and most probably a real market need for a privacy respecting coin will always be there. (eg. Monero is already a primary payment method for buying branded Tor onion domains).",

It is an open source protocol that gives users the ability to access and use code without restrictions. The coin is based on Bitcoin 0.13, hence features most of Bitcoin's components with some improvements. \n\nNavCoin boasts of a dual blockchain that makes its transactions faster than those of Bitcoin. While Bitcoin transactions take an average of 10 minutes, NavCoin network takes just 30 seconds. Its use of oof-of-Stake consensus means that it has no need of specialized mining machines and thus low energy consumption. It also significantly lowers the cost of transactions in the web3 economy. The cost of a transaction is estimated to be 0.0001 NAV. \n\nNavCoin is a special crypto aiming at simplifying the use of the blockchain technology. Its developers want to create a platform where anyone irrespective of their crypto knowledge can use digital money for everyday transactions. It is also a privacy network ensuring that users remain unidentified thanks to its use of the RCA (2048 bit length keys) that are very difficult to break and a subchain process. It in addition incorporates SegWit, making it flexible for further developments in the future. \n\nNavcoin comes with its own unique wallets classified as 'full' and 'light' wallets. Here's a list of wallets currently available:\n\nNavCoin Core - A full wallet that allows network staking\n\nNavPay - A light wallet with simple features and uses less gigabyte space\n\nNext - A full wallet that is stylish, allows staking and has a simple interface\n\nCoinomi - A multi-wallet that supports Bitcoin and other cryptos in addition to NavCoin.\n\nNavCoin M8 - This is a staking wallet that is highly powered and provides users with DIY options\n\nNavPi StakeBox - A full wallet that uses Raspberry-Pi platform and is low energy\n\nNavPaper - A wallet able to generate keys that are stored offline for security purposes\n\nNavcoin is also available in a variety of exchanges key among them being Bittrex and Poloniex.\n\nThe network is run and supported by a decentralized community. It relies on Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm making it lightweight and thus no need for huge servers. The algorithm stakes about 5% annually. In order to stake, you simply need NavCoin Core wallet then transfer your NAV coins to the wallet.",

This makes the blockchain centralized permission based, as opposed to decentralized blockchains like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Stellar is a community driven open source project launched in November 2014 and written on C++. It is maintained and supervised by non-profit organisation Stellar.org.\n\nThe main purpose of creating this ockchain was to expands access to low-cost financial services. Stellar operates with its own token Lumen, supply of which increases a fixed rate of 1% a year. Main difference from Bitcoin is that it is based on the SCP consensus algorithm rather than mining, which means transactions are being confirmed within 2-7 seconds. Stellar has an SDKs that allows users to connect to the blockchain with external software written in Java, Golang, JavaScript, C#, Ruby, Python, Scala, iOS or any other software using REST API. Each transaction has a cost of 100 Stroops (0.00001 Lumens).\n\nStellar is mainly used by Money transfer companies like Tempo, Eurochange and TransferTo and mobile financial services providers like Coins.ph.",

The purpose of SYScoin is to fulfill the original vision of Satoshi Nakamoto i.e. marketplace on the blockchain. SYScoin blockchain claims to be better than Bitcoin is many ways because it provides near zero cost transactions using native SYScoin with Z-DAG protocol (Zero-Confirmation-Directed-Acyclic-Graph). The underlying blockchain of SYScoin has two consensus layers. The first layer arranges the transaction in an order before recorded on the blockchain. This layer provides instant settlement of the transaction. The second layer confirms the transaction using the Proof of Work protocol. The next generation SYScoin blockchain integrates \"Blockmarket 3.0\" which allows the users to buy or sell to anyone in a decentralized manner. Syscoin is presently being used in decentralized marketplace known as Blockmarket and is available to download from their official website. \n\nSYScoin ecosystem offers a number of services apart from sending and receiving the money. These services on the blockchain include Aliases (Eliminated the complex wallet addresses), decentralized marketplace, Encrypted messaging (for the marketplace), Arbitrated Escrow and Digital Certificates (to store and transfer small documents). \n\nSyscoin was created and developed by Sebastian Schepis. He is core developer at SYScoin. The team consists of 9 other members. There are 5 members from community team. Syscoin is based on hybrid consensus algorithms i.e. proof of work and Masternodes. The desktop wallet acts as a node which is limited to sending and receiving the Syscoins. The Masternode requires to hold 100,000 Syscoins. The Masternode is incentivized during block rewards. 67.5% of the reward goes to Masternodes.",

It provides a value token called \"Ubiq (UBQ)\", which was generated by transferring the value of a three-year old established token, Jumbucks (JBS), onto a blockchain with Ethereum functionality. Thus, it provides EVM functionality in a blockchain segregated technologically, politically, and conceptually from Ethereum or Ethereum Classic.",

Since Bitcoin transactions are not really anonymous and can be traced back to its user, Verge aims to address this privacy issues. It is powered by the Wraith protocol which adds additional features on top of a guaranteed layer of privacy.\n\nVerge’s lead developer is Justin Erik Valo aka Sunerok and the project is completely community driven. Verge (XVG) was earlier known as DogeDarkCoin but was renamed to Verge in early 2016 for marketing reasons. One of the unique feature of Verge is that it uses 5 different Proof of Work hashing algorithm (Scrypt, X17, Lyra2rev2, myr-groestl and blake2s) with average hash time of about 30 seconds. The total supply of Verge is 16.5 billion coins.",

The 3D blockchain makes use of three consensus channels to make it secure, scalable and efficient. The three consensus channels are implemented through TRITIUM (trust staking protocol), AMINE (level-1 sharding channels) and OBSIDIAN (Level 3 sharding cubes). The Nexus team is also working on the quantum resistant 3D blockchain software. Using 3D blockchain consensus protocol, Nexus reaches consensus every 50 seconds on average. Nexus coin is available to use after 6 confirmations. The total supply of Nexus will be 78 million and will be achieved in 10 years. After 10 years, the currency will inflate by 3% each year. Nexus claims to be one of the most secure blockchains because its hashing consists of two secure hashing algorithms i.e. Keccak and Skein. Compared to Bitcoin (256 bit Hash), Nexus hash is 1024 bit. Nexus can be generated by three methods i.e. Hashing-the user runs the code, Holdings-proof of holding rewards and Dense Prime Clusters-Work done by miners. These features of Nexus makes it one of the secure, efficient and scalable blockchain network.\n\nNexus was founded by Colin Cantrell, who is also the current chief software architect at Nexus. The board consists of 10 other members. There are 8 core developers at Nexus and three advisors including Steve Beauregard who is Partner and Chief revenue officer at Bloq Inc.",

It was built on top of Omni Layer digital currency protocol, which works on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThe main purpose of this token is to provide stability to traders and members of cryptocurrency market, because Tether is claimed to be backed by US dollars on Tether Ltd bank accounts, so its price is not as volatile as prices of other cryptocurrencies. However, that remains yet to be proven and is is the reason why the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission issued subpoenas to both Tether and Bitfinex. Also Tether Ltd underlines that the Tether token is not a financial instrument, and the owners of Tethers have no rights for legal claims or guarantees against losses.\n\nNevertheless, tether is a very popular token and is used by a number of exchanges (mostly the crypto to crypto only ones) as their main stablecoin. The amount of Tethers grew up to $2.8 billion. During summer 2018 around 80% of Bitcoin volume was traded in Tethers.",

Its founder, Vitalik Buterin, has been engaged in the development of blockchain and Bitcoin since its inception.\n\nToday, several cryptocurrencies are issued in ICOs using Ethereum. These tokens are called ERC-20, and they are the foundation for running scripts in the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Through the development of \"smart contracts\", Ethereum made it possible to sign tokens that have a specific function besides being a medium of exchange and broadened the capabilities of blockchain \"transactions\".\n\nIts key cryptocurrency is the Ether, which is usually used for payments in smart contracts or dApps. In addition, Ethereum is also fueled with GAS, a cryptocurrency associated with operations that require some kind of computation from its nodes. The GAS price is proportional to the type of the computational power required execute a task. Therefore, a fee in GAS is included to pay for the nodes running or authenticating a transaction.\n\nOriginally, Ethereum used proof-of-work to reach consensus. The Casper protocol, however, gradually shifted Ethereum consensus from PoW to a custom proof-of-stake protocol.",

All storage contracts and all Sia payment channels require owning siacoins. This requirement means that as Sia grows in usage, so too will demand for siacoins.\n\nAs demand grows, the price will increase. If Sia is being used for billions of dollars of storage, billions of dollars of siacoins will be required.

It was originally created by someone under the pseudonym \"s3v3n h4cks\" but the team now comprises of various community members.\n\nPIVX has its own blockchain. It was originally created with 60,000 PIV on genesis block as premine in order to help setup 6 early masternodes. However, all of the premine was later destroyed at block 279917, order to avoid any potential manipulation in the economy of PIVX\n\nFinally, PIVX is based on proof of work using the Zerocoin protocol and it is supported by the use of masternodes. Every masternode requires 10000 PIVX as minimum stake in order to be functional.",

The DGX token is issued using the Proof of Asset (PoA) protocol. For PoA, Digix uses proof of asses cards which require filling of information such as SKU of Gold bar, Bar serial number, purchase receipt, depository receipt and storage fees due. These proof of asset cards can be stored in an Ethereum wallet. For every proof of asset card sent to minter smart contract, an equivalent amount of DGX tokens will be issued to the user. For example, for 1000g gold proof of asset card sent to minter smart contract, 1000 DGX tokens will be given to the user. \n\nDGD is a governance token for DigixDAO. DigixDAO is a community-driven project and actively involves the DGD token holders in shaping the physical asset tokenization business. \n\nDigix was founded by Kai C. Chng who is also the CEO of the company. He worked as an EMFX trader in wall street. The team consists of 18 other members. \n\nThe purpose of DGX token is to trade the physical gold securely and efficiently using blockchain technology.",

The Ardor blockchain offers several improved features such as the existence of multiple blockchains (child chains) on the main chain. The child chain can be created independently and be privately owned. The single security blockchain (ARDR) bundled with several child chains offers three advantages i.e. giving multiple tokens for transactions, reduces the blockchain bloat and interoperable ready to use child chains. \n\nArdor blockchain is developed by the Jelurida B.V. company lead by Lior Yaffe.. The same company founded the NXT blockchain.\n\nThe purpose of Ardor is to provide a platform for large organizations or small and medium industries to shift on blockchain easily using the child chains with ready to use features. Child chains provide robust security of the parent Ardor chain while it is customizable according to individual needs.",

We are the first to innovate, develop and implement Proof of Disintegration (PoD) successfully into a blockchain, giving birth to the world's first Fundamental Nodes (FNs). \n\nPoD completely destroys coins from the blockchain when a user sends enough coins to create a FN. Reducing circulating/total supply, PoD eliminates the risk of coins re-entering the supply, a significant attribute/innovation over Proof of Burn (PoB) which traditionally accumulates coins in an external wallet, hiding coins from the supply, with the possibility of re-entering at a later date. While PoD only currently works in the creation of FNs, B3 Coin plans to implement more supply reducing features using PoD, such as micro-disintegrations on transactions. \n\nWith the release of a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) on the horizon, B3 Coin is positioned to be a unique \"supply-disintegration machine\". Reducing supply, rewarding FN operators and with a supportive community, our DEX will stand alone with a promising future in the cryosphere. \n\nB3 Coin combines the growing support of it's community, with the success of integrating PoD, and our unique \"supply-disintegration machine\" of a DEX to be released in the future, B3 Coin will take the lead in anti-inflationary coins.",

It utilizes Zero-knowledge cryptographic proofs to hide transaction history and balances. With this protocol, you can mint your own private coin, spend it and mine another without revealing your identity. \n\nZcoin uses the Lyra2 hashing algorithm, but is soon to be replaced by Merkle Tree Proof (MTP) to enable democratic mining. There is a difference between Zcoin and Zcash. Even though the two pplement one another, they depend on different cryptographic codes. Zcoin uses RSA accumulators while Zcash utilizes zk-SNARKs. They both use trusted setups but have them implemented differently. \n\nZcoin was initially meant to be a Bitcoin extension, but was later developed independently. The main aim of this coin is to hide the identity of its users, ensuring freedom and anonymity in commerce. You can carry out a crypto transaction using this coin without worrying about revealing your address balance of history. \n\nThe coin's developers include its founder Poramin Insom, Tadhg Riordan, the Solidity developer, Peter Shugalev, the lead core developer.\n\nIn order for a node to have the ability to run a full blockchain to enable transactions to take place on the network, it requires staking of 1000 XZC.",

Zcash implements the \"Zerocash\" protocol which offers a high level of privacy. Using the Bitcoin's core code, Zcash implements the decentralized-anonymous-payment scheme. Although transactions are recorded on the blockchain, zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (zk-SNARKs) protocol hide all information about the sender, receiver and amount of transaction. To verify a transactions, a \"Zero-knowledge proof\" protocol is used. Verification take place  without revealing the sender or receiver and transaction size. These three pieces of information are recorded in an encrypted form on the blockchain and are not publicly accessible. \n\nZcash was founded by Zooko Wilcox, who is also the present CEO. He is known for his contribution to Digicash, ZRTP and SPHINCS. The team consists of 31 members and 6 advisors including Gavin Anderson and Vitalik Buterin. There are 4 members providing outside councilling for this project.",

Golem Network enables anyone to use the distributed computing power for running high-end applications such as machine learning and AI. Similarly, anyone with a computer can share their computing power in the pool. This computing power is monetized accordingly. Golem Network can produce processing power intensive computer-generated imagery within seconds. All the payments are done using Golem Network Token-GNT for the above operations. \n\nGolem Network Token was developed by Julian Zawistowski who is the present CEO of the project. The team consists of 34 other members including developers, marketers and business managers. \n\nThe purpose of Golem Network Token is to provide an immense amount of decentralized processing power for processing-intensive software or graphics rendering. The user pays in GNT for the power he buys while the provider gets GNT for the processing power they share in the pool. The major use of shared processing power is in the development of AI-based programs, Machine learning, big data analytics, and scientific research.",

    "description": "Byteball is a cryptocurrency platform, which uses directed acyclic graph (DAG) instead of blockchain. In a blockchain all the transactions are joined into blocks, and a block can be mined (a special signature should be found by one of the nodes). In a DAG most of the transactions are asynchronous: a transaction occurs when both seller and buyer are ready to sign two legs of the exchange. Byteball is an open source project, initially started in September 2016 by a team of Russian developers, but now is international. Byteball operates with coin called byte.\n\nMain differences from classical blockchains are atomic exchange (through DAG), possibility of multi-signature and textcoins. Despite atomic exchange, vendors can issue regulated assets, which require co-signature of the issuer, so the sale complies with anti money laundering regulations. Textcoins is an option to send cryptocurrency via email or chat. Multi signature means that to spend funds two or more signatures are required, this is used for shared control funds.\n\nAnother feature of Byteball is that 99% of its currency (byte) is being distributed for free through cashback deals and referrals.",

Spectrecoin is actively developed, with an ambitious roadmap that prioritises privacy, security, and true decentralisation with features such as default stealth addresses and stealth staking, and low-power mobile wallet staking in our upcoming Android wallet.\n\nThe goal of Spectrecoin is to combine a blockchain with a tokenized ring-signature scheme to build a system of anonymous digital cash. The ring-signature scheme used here was first introduced by ShadowCash, and is now being improved on by the Spectrecoin developers. For network-level privacy, all nodes communicate exclusively within the Tor network via hidden services. The priorities of the Spectrecoin project are on privacy, technical soundness and simplicity. The Proof-of-Stake consensus method is used to provide environmental friendliness, decentralization and transaction speed. The project is built by a professional team and around open participation of its community member, development is funded through an innovative staking-reward donation system and voluntary direct funding.",

MKR is an ERC-20 token created in response to insufficient collateral to back for DAI CDPs.\n\nDAI is created through loan contracts which use Ether as a collateral. MKR Holders are responsible for regulating the collateralized rate making DAI consistently worth $1 and are rewarded for doing it; CDPs include a fee which is paid using MKR that is always burned, evating MKR's value. \n\nCDPs are automatically liquidated in case Ether drops to a price such that their collateral (ETH) drops below a given value that is not enough to finance the amount of DAI loaned. If the liquidated volume recovered isn't enough to cover for the corresponding DAI volume loaned, the Maker system automatically creates new MKR tokens which are sold in open markets ensuring a positive balance. This mechanism incentives MKR holders to make rational decisions when voting for collateralized rates.\n\nMakerDAO, the group responsible for Maker, also run a decentralized exchange called OasisDEX.",

With this, they offer the same security level of Bitcoin. Kmodo also offers a framework for creating independent blockchains with blocks notarized to it (and, therefore o Bitcoin). Mining uses the equihash algorithm, so it's ASIC resistant.\n\nThrough their dICO platform, anyone can launch an ICO with total anonymity, with a blockchain within the Komodo ecosystem or not. Komodo also features the BarterDEX decentralized exchange, which uniquely supports trading between different pairs using atomic swaps for increased speed.",

This features eliminates the need for mining and allows almost instant and zero fee transactions. Nano is PoS system where participants vote with a weight equivalent to the amount of wealth they possess. Because of it's PoS feature, Nano is generally considered more energy efficient than Bitcoin.\n\nNanocurrency (NANO) is the re-branded name of RaiBlocks (XRB) which was created by Colin LeMahieu to solve its scalability problem, high transfer time, and high fees. He moved to the project full time in 2017 to advance Nano's development. Nano is now backed by small team of developers.",

It is a fork of Ethereum and as such provides its own blockchain running Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The EVM backbone is used to transfer revenue for playing songs from listeners to artists on pay-per-play basis. Musicoin is part of Enterprise Ethereum Alliance.\n\nMusicoin aims at simplifying the process of revenue generation and distribution. Content creators can devise system of revenue distribution among themselves and all parties involved in the process of content creation. Smart contracts then distribute the revenue as specified by this system. This allows for cryptographically safe, secure, and automated payouts, offering an alternative to current revenue generation and distribution methods, most notably online advertisements.\n\nOn 17th December 2017 it was announced that there are currently 1500 independent registered artists.",

The former Nist5 algorithm was replaced by XEVAN. \n\n  XEVAN was founded by the Bitsend developer and has since then proven to be a stable, ASIC resistant\n\n  and efficient algorithm. The Xevan hash algorithm is a unique combination from the dual X17\n\n  difficulty algorithm with an extension to 128 bits. Solaris has many unique features which\n\n  distinguish it from other cryptocurrencies, some of which include a decentralized governance system\n\n  which employs masternodes and an 'instant send' feature allowing transactions to be confirmed\n\n  instantaneously. \n\n  Solaris understands that everyone has the right to privacy and so the wallet includes privacy\n\n  features that give users the option to perform XLR transactions anonymously. On 16th December 2017,\n\n  Solaris wallet with Zerocoin protocol support was released. Zerocoin transactions will be enabled on\n\n  the network at block 259300",

Both Proof of Work (used in Bitcoins) and Proof of Stake (used in Ethereum) have their demerits and are prone to \"51% attack\". Skycoin blockchain uses web-of-trust consensus algorithm known as Obelisk. This algorithm allows the nodes and the general community to audit the network with a high degree of accuracy. This consensus protocols have several other advantages such as high scalability and low energy consumption, immune to 51% attack, robust defense (against large-scale coordinated attacks) and Two node structure.\n\nSkycoin transactions complete in 2 seconds. The transaction fee is taken in \"coin hour\" a separate currency paid to Skycoin holders for each hour they hold the coin. 1000 coins held for 1 hour will generate 1000 \"coin hours\". Coin hours are linked to various other services such as VPN service or movie downloads from Popcorn Time and over the counter services.\n\nThe maximum supply of Skycoin is 100 million coins. Skycoin provides an ecosystem and complete solution for shifting from Web 2.0 (Centralized) to Web3.0 (decentralized) The Ecosystem comprises of Skycoin (cryptocurrency), CX (A Turing complete programming language), Skywire (Decentralized internet), Obelisk (Consensus mechanism for blockchain), Fiber (the foundation of cryptocurrency 3.0) and skyminer (Hardware).\n\nSkycoin was founded by Synth (earlier contributor Bitcoin), Houwu Chen (One of the creators of Ethereum), Steve Leonard (Skycoin software developer). The advisory board consists of 4 members and two companies TokenKey and SharkCIA.",

Qtum is an open source project which combines the benefits of both Bitcoin and Ethereum on a single chain. The peer to peer value transfer is completed using QTUM's proprietary \"Value Transfer Protocol\". To be compatible with Bitcoin's Improvement Proposals (BIPs), QTUM uses \"Incentive Proof of Stake (IPoS)\" smart contract platform. QTUM supports smart apps, Dapps and Go Mobile Strategy. The total QTUM available to the world will be 100 million. QTUM block size is 2Mb and a block is mined after 2 minutes. \n\nQTUM was developed by the Singapore based QTUM foundation. The team consists of developers from both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Presently QTUM team comprises of 30 members including developers, business managers, marketers, and administrators. QTUM project is backed by 10 members including XU Star who is CEO at OKCOIN. \n\nQTUM solves the 4 major issues of the current blockchain technology. The present blockchain (Bitcoin &amp; Ethereum) lacks the interaction with real-world data. Blockchains are incompatible with each other. Consensus mechanisms are inflexible and they lack industry compliance such as Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customers (KYC). QTUM solves these problems by bridging the gaps between Bitcoin and Ethereum. A Master Contract is a new kind of smart contract-compatible with different blockchains. QTUM provides industry-focused consensus protocols. QTUM considers the regulations and integrates the \"provide identity modules\".",

    "description": "Aeternity is a platform for developing smart contracts founded by Yanislav Malahov, one of the earliest members of the Ethereum team. It differentiates from other platforms which do the same by running smart contracts on \"state channels\" instead of a blockchain. Smart contracts are normally signed and then executed and verified peer-to-peer. In case of conflict, Aeternity's blockchain can check them for correctness. This relieves the blockchain from congestion and, besides providing privacy for the contractors and reducing costs, it also solves most part of the scalability problem currently afflicting most major smart contract platforms.\n\nIt also introduces oracles, which links smart contracts to real-world decision-makers. In many cases, smart contracts depend upon reporting facts which cannot be obtained purely by code, so human (or IoT) oracles are designated to stake their coins in such contracts' results, e.g.., weather conditions or election results.\n\nThe platform makes use of both PoS and PoW, although PoS is used exclusively for their delegated PoS-system. Authentication consensus is reached using an ASIC-resistant PoW system called Cuckoo Cycle in which even mobile devices are able to mine efficiently. Thus, Aeternity is a PoW blockchain with a dPoS system for governance.",

ETP (the token) can be transferred, is traceable, immutable and can be used as a collateral on the blockchain. It can also be registered easily and freely, issued and burnt. It is especially used to pay for digital content on the Metaverse blockchain. \n\nAt the moment, one practical use of ETP, is that it can be used to tokenize intellectual property on the taverse blockchain. Users have full control of their property, protecting them from asset theft. ETP is currently listed in a number of major exchanges including Bitfinex, Coinsuper, HitBTC, Bit-Z and Coinbene among others.  \n\nThe Metaverse project came into existence in 2016 and went live in 2017. It is the brainchild of a developer and blockchain enthusiast Eric Gu, who is also the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of ViewFin. Gu played a vital role in developing the first blockchain in China in 2016. Metaverse promises to provide an infrastructure on which users can have their digital content and intellectual property tokenized. The platform's developers believe that the future will be powered by the blockchain and are, thus, working to improve on this platform. \n\nMetaverse's ICO completed on September 2016 raising the total of $3.00 M.",

The amount of computational power one is entitled to is proportional to how many EOS tokens they're holding and the total EOS in circulation.\n\nApplications run smoother on EOS because of its parallel processing capability. It has a dPoS system, in which 21 elected nodes are elected as block producers. These nodes are constantly checked for availability and if they are unable to produce a block over a 24h time-span, their position is revoked.",

It is the first decentralized, end-to-end encrypted cloud storage that uses blockchain technology and cryptography to secure your files.\n\nStorj is a platform, cryptocurrency, and suite of decentralized applications that allows you to store data in a secure and decentralized manner. Your files are encrypted, shredded into little pieces called 'shards', and stored in a decentralized network of computers around the globe. No one but you has a complete copy of your file, not even in an ecrypted form.\n\nBecause of this, Storj can be faster, cheaper, and more secure than traditional cloud storage platforms. Faster because multiple machines are serving you your file simultaneously, cheaper because you are renting people's spare hard-drive space instead of paying for a purpose-built data center, and more secure because your file is both encrypted and shredded. There is no need to trust a corporation, vulnerable servers, or employees with your files. Storj completely removes trust from the equation.\n\nStorj uses blockchain features like a transaction ledger, public/private key encryption, and cryptographic hash functions for security.\n\nStorj is working hard to solve data security issues with the help of its own web app, Storj, which lets you store your files, and client app, Storj Share, which lets you rent your hard-drive space for money.\n\nTo best protect your data, files are encrypted client-side on your computer before they are uploaded. Each file is split up into chunks which are first encrypted and then distributed for storage across the Storj network. The network is comprised of Storj Share nodes run by users around the world who rent out their unused hard drive space in return for Storj Token (STORJ).\n\nThe decentralized aspect of Storj means there are no central servers to be compromised, and with client-side encryption, your are in control of the keys to your files.",

PPT tokens can be used to purchase invoices that, when paid, return Pokens to the buyer.\n\nPPTs are ERC-20 tokens and their contracts are recorded onto the Ethereum blockchain.",

    "description": "BitCoin Cash is a cryptocurrency resulting from a hard fork from Bitcoin in August 2017.\n\nIt was forked just before Bitcoin had implemented SegWit, so, unlike Bitcoin, BCH doesn't include this feature. It has a block size limit of 8 MB, in contrast to Bitcoin's 1 MB. This allows for a much higher transaction throughput, i.e. 61 transactions per second, while Bitcoin is limited to 7.  Also Bitcoin Cash's algorithm adjusts its difficulty every 6 blocks instead of 2016 blocks (Bitcoin).\n\nIn ice, transaction fees are also significantly lower in BCH than in BTC.",

The token was launched on the first quarter of 2017, had its initial public presale in the third quarter of the same year and its initial coin offering (ICO) in the fourth quarter of 2017. The token aim to align dentist/patient needs and interests in an effort to improve dental health care all over the world. \n\nDentacoin is an Ethereum erc20 token that relies on smart contracts. It is rrently listed in a variety of exchanges including Changelly, HitBTC, Cryptopia, Mercantox etc. and it is supported by a variety of ERC20 compatible wallets including MyEtherWallet, Coinnomi etc. \n\nThe main purpose of this token is to make dental healthcare affordable all over the world. It will be possible for dentists to get long term payments and make this care affordable. American Dentists Association estimate that about 440 billion dollars are spent annually on dental healthcare. The association projects that if a proper structure is set up enabling individuals to get preventative check-ups at least three times annually, this cost can be cut by a staggering 90%, coupled with improved health habits and better nutrition. This token is projected to play a crucial role in enabling such care around the world. \n\nThe token was developed by a group of professional scientists and developers who are also blockchain enthusiasts. Key among them are the founder Prof. Dr. Dimitar Dimitrakiev, co-founder and business developer Philip Grenzebach, co-founder and core developer Jeremias Grenzebach and graphic designer and web developer Daniel Kolarov among others\n\nBeing a blockchain based token, it will be utilized to pay for dental care and related services. Considering how difficult it is to find a trusted dentist, Dentacoin will reward contributors with DCN coins for honest reviews to connect patients with honest dentists. It also seeks to remove the lengthy supply chains to reduce the cost of medication.",

It is this token that peers on the network use to facilitate various transactions. The tokens are ed for decentralized governance over the platform which helps in minimizing disruptions on the network. It also helps create a feedback loop from which developers can benefit by its wider adoption. Coordination problems within the network are also solved using the token. \n\nThe main use of the 0x platform is to have developers build exchange applications and carryout low friction exchange of Ethereum based tokens. \n\nThe team behind this project stems from various fields including research, engineering, business and design. The most notable members are CEO and co-founder Will Warren, CTO and co-founder Amir Bandeali and senior engineer Fabio Berger among others.",

    "description": "WaltonChain is a business ecosystem that leverages the power of the blockchain technology and the RFID (Radio Frequency Identification Technology) as well as reader-writer control chip. The ecosystem is particularly useful in the supply and distribution industry. Products are given special tags that can be traced throughout the entire distribution chain. The RFID technology ensures maximum security, provides a dedicated storage space, utilizes less power as compared to other technologies and ensures a low probability of record skipping. Distributors can easily track particular commodities by using special electronic codes. \n\nThe ecosystem brings together the real world (physical assets) and a blockchain converting the internet into the Value Internet of Things (IoT). Using the blockchain technology enables the sharing of important data and transparency. The RFID technology adds on to this making counterfeiting and data manipulation very difficult. The ecosystem utilizes Waltoncoin (WTC) as the fuel for enabling transactions. WTC can be used as a currency for transaction within the ecosystem, as a unit of quality measurement, as a store of value and as a transfer of value within the ecosystem.\n\nThe ecosystem relies on masternodes with a node or an account becoming a master node if it holds more than 5000 WTC. The more WTC an account holds, and the longer the time it holds, the greater the reward is. It also utilizes a consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Stake &amp; Trust as well as smart contracts. This ecosystem also allows users to create child chains where they can create their own tokens creating additional demand for WTC.\n\nN/B WWaltonChain is a business ecosystem or platform and not a token.",

LRC solves the problem of security and transparency caused by centralized exchanges. It also provides the solution for liquidity issues in decentralized exchanges. Although LRC itself is not a decentralized exchange, it is developed as a modular protocol for building decentralized exchanges on multiple blockchains. LRC provides various security features such as front-running prevention, Sybil attack, and insufficient balance. Other features include off-chain order management, on-chain settlement and dual authoring. The fee structure os exchange is of two types i.e. ring matching cost saving and the transaction fee. \n\nLoopring was founded by Daniel Wang, who is a Google tech lead, CEO of coinport exchange and senior director of Zhongan technology. The team consists of 20 members and 12 advisers. The LRC project is running under Loopring foundation. \n\nThe major use of Loopring is to provide the user with a decentralized exchange solution for their respective cryptocurrencies. As Loopring is developed above the parent blockchain (ETH, NEO, QTUM etc), it provides an off chain order management.",

Po.et works with the Proof of Existence (PoE) protocol and extends the hashing and timestamping algorithm by incorporating additional metadata and discoverability in the existing Proof of Existence protocol.  Po.et solves the problem of copying and illegaly distributing digital works. Po.et records data of ownership and metadata on the distributed ledger with a data layer on the top to protect digital media assets. The publisher or owner can generate an infinite number of titles, timestamped and registered with the Po.et network. Using smart contracts, Po.et allows the user to generate automate the licensing process. \n\nPo.et is lead by Jarrod Dicker who is the current CEO and former vice president of innovation and commercial strategy at The Washington Post. Eric Elliott is VP of Engineering at Po.et. He is the author of \"programming JavaScript Application\". The team consists of David Turner as the Head of the product.\n\nThe purpose of Po.et is to address three core issues of digital media i.e. ownership, utilization, and history. \"Ownership\" defines the owner of the digital asset. The record is maintained on a public ledger and thus cannot be tempered. \"Utilization\" requires the POE token which serves as the economic layer for Po.et platform. \"History\" explains the origin of the asset, its market value, and record of economics related to the asset. The use cases include publishers, content creators, and the services offered by both.",

However, in June 2018 Tron foundation launched their own proprietary Blockchain that promised to have higher transaction speeds than Ethereum. The transaction speed of Tron in tests was 2000 Transactions per second (TPS) compared to Ethereum 25 TPS. The shifting from Ethereum blockchain to Tron blockchain was completed by burning 1 billion ERC-20 tokens (TRX). Tron is available on major exchanges such as Binance, OKEx, Huobi, Kucoin, Bittrex etc.\n\nThe purpose of TRX coin is to be a decentralized content distribution platform for the social media and digital entertainment industry. Some of the features of TRX includes the ability to upload, save and download images, audio, video, and characters. Tron can be considered as a next generation social media outlet where one can share the content with anyone on the internet and get paid in form of TRX coin. It empowers the user to manage, secure and distribute the content as and when required, thus enhancing the privacy. \n\nTron is the vision of Justin Sun, who is the founder and CEO of Tron foundation. He remained a chief representative of Ripple (XRP) in China. He is also the founder of \"Peiwo\" website with a registered user base of over 10 million. The live streaming app of \"Peiwo\" is fully integrated with Tron. Tron is headed to revolutionize the social media with its decentralization technology.",

ChainLink is an open source project, started at September 2017 by a company SmartContract. This company was already creating secure oracles for Bitcoin and Ethereum for over 3 years, but in 2017 decided to move towards their own middleware ChainLink. At the moment ChainLink is maintained by 3 developers.\n\nThe main purpose for creating ChainLink was to provide nnectivity between blockchains and external software such as bank payments, retail payments (Visa, Paypal), market data (NYSE, Bloomberg) and backend systems (SalesForce, SAP). This allows to integrate blockchain with off-chain sales and local payments, to turn them into smart contracts in exchange for LINK tockens. LINK token is an EIP20  Ethereum token with some additional functions. ICO for LINK tokens was completed on September 2017 raising total of $32.00 M.\n\nCurrently ChainLink only works with Ropsten, a test Ethereum network.",

    "description": "ADA is a crypto coin running on Cardano Settlement Layer (CSL) blockchain, the first and most secure blockchain based on Proof of stake mechanism validating the transactions. Cardano team calls their proof of stake mechanism Ouroboros. Unlike Proof of Work, where miners invest energy intensive computing power to mine each block, proof of stake chooses a random miner based on the size of the stake (value). In order to generate or mint a new block, a slot leader is chosen with a probability proportional to the amount of coins this node is carrying. So one of ADA's advantages over Bitcoin, Ethereum and other similar cryptocurrencies is its energy-efficient proof of stake transaction validation system. ADA is flexible like Ethereum due to a second layer Cardano Computational Layer (CCL) which supports decentralized applications and smart contracts.\n\nADA was initially created by Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK), a blockchain development firm. The project was led by Charles Hoskinson who was a former co-founder of Ethereum, Etereum classic and Bitshares.  Presently the ADA team consist of three organizations i.e. Cardano foundation, IOHK, and Emurgo. \n\nThe major use of Cardano is the transfer of value. Future development of applications on CCL layer can provide the easy and economical payment solution to service providers such as Uber, Upwork, and alike.",

By facilitating the formal verification of smart contracts it helps avoiding buggy code. Other than that, it is similar to the Ethereum blockchain, allowing creation and formalization of smart contracts. The platform creates governance rules that stakeholders within the network must abide with when verifying transactions. he key features of this platform is on-chain governance and self-amendment.\n\nTezos' network follows a different protocol method from the conventional blockchain. It is using a generic network shell focused on a modular strategy. The project is written in the OCaml programming language.\n\nIn terms of validating and signing of blocks, Tezos has adapted a delegated proof-of-stake consensus algorithm. In this staking method, stakeholders, known as bakers participate in Tezos' baking process. The backers are required to deposit some tokens and then get rewarded for signing blocks or punished for errant behavior. Punishment includes losing one's deposits\n\nTezos hopes to better its predecessors by giving stakeholders full control of the network hence enhancing decentralization. The network is the brain child of Arthur Breitman, a French mathematician and scientist and his wife Kathleen Breitman, who has a background in the financial sector.",

Today RChain has 46 independent contributors.\n\nThe main purpose of RChain was to add scalability to public blockchains. For example, in Bitcoin every single transaction is shared with every single member of the chain. Instead of storing the ledger, RChain stores a state of a virtual computer. Also instead of using Proof-of-Work, ich is very expensive due to the required computing power and a lot of electricity consumed, RChain uses a Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm. For applications RChain uses Smart Contracts. These smart contracts can be written on Rholang and have to follow formal verification methods for better scalability. Also unlike Ethereum, RChain uses a sharding algorithm (Rho Calculus), which divides the whole network in pieces, so that computers from home network will share all the transactions only in their sub-chain. These pieces are called Rho Virtual Machines (RhoVM). One node can be part of multiple sub-chains.\n\nDevelopers of RChain position their product as Facebook and Visa at the same time. RChain had private ICO in August-September 2017 which raised 30M USD. Finally, RChain developers plan to start several native economic tokens. One has already been launched already coin called Revenu (REV).",

BitcoinZ launched with no premine, no developer fees, no ICO, was not a chain fork of any coin - it started at Block 1.  In addition to these founding principles, BitcoinZ has also committed itself to always being GPU mineable and resist ASIC miners.\n\nAside from its strict adherence to its founding principles, BitcoinZ prides itself in pushing the limits of decentralization by 100% community inclusion - the community posts open and public proposals for change and proposals are voting on.  The community infrastructure is also community owned - no one person can revoke their contribution in a manner that degrades service to the community. Progress is achieved by complete volunteerism, with some proposals seeking a budget from community donations - mostly from member mining activities and pools supporting the project by setting their pools to auto-donate.",

    "description": "The Enigma (ENG) is an erc20 token that serves as a currency in the Enigma platform. Enigma is a platform that seeks to solve blockchain's scalability and privacy issues. It is these two issues that have plagued the growth of this technology towards achieving mass adoption. Enigma is an off-chain network that provides an extra layer over data storage and private computation. It protects users’ data and still allow computation over the same. \n\nThis network is equipped with unique features sent from other blockchain platforms that enable it to achieve its intended purpose. These features are:\n\nPlatform Layer - It is on this that users can build any kind of platforms like market places and secure their private data.\n\nProtocol Layer - This layer helps in the private and decentralized computation of sensitive data.\n\nApplication Layer - Developers can build any dApps that need security and private computation. \n\nEnigma is able to secure private data by hiding input data from the chain's nodes. The first working application for this platform is called the Catalyst. This application is designed for data-driven digital asset investments as well as for research. It is ideal for professional traders. \n\nENG token is available in notable exchanges like Binance, Huobi, OKEx, Mercatox, GOPAX, Liqui and Bittrex. It is compatible with erc20 wallets like Ledger Nano S, MyEtherWallet, Trezor, Parity and MetaMask among others.\n\nThe project is the idea of experts from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and other experts. Notable among them is Guy Zyskind, co-founder and CEO as well as a software developer, Can Kisagun, the chief product officer and co-founder and Victor Grau Serrat, the director of engineering.",

Developing any application on this network also requires the use Aion tokens as the Aion Virtual Machine is run using the tokens. You can connect an Aion network to another blockchain by staking Aion tokens and building a Bridge Registry Contract. Aion token is based on the Ethereum blockchain. In other words, it is an erc20 token , however, once the Aion network is developed fully, it will be possible to convert these tokens into Aion network tokens and back, but by the end of November, erc20 tokens will not be supported. During the swap, holders will get an equal equivalent of Aion coins as their erc20 tokens\n\nAion network is a third-generation, multi-tier blockchain system that enables the passing of value and logic among various participating blockchain. The platform was developed to address the issues plaguing the blockchain such as scalability, interoperability and privacy. It is now possible to securely connect blockchains and also have dissimilar networks communicate with each other. \n\nAION token comes with its own Aion Wallet and is listed in a number of exchanges. These exchanges include Binance, Ethfinex, Liqui, Kucoin, Koinex, Bitfinex and Bancor Network among others. It is also supported by other wallets including Exodus, Inifinito and Citowise. You can decide to keep your tokens either in any of your preferred wallets or exchanges.\n\nThe project has an able team of scientists and developers with engineers Aayush, Alexandra and Ali leading the pack.",

It has gained popular use because of its wide range of cryptocurrencies available for trade and relatively low fees compared with leading exchanges. Another reason for its popularity is its way of incentivizing traders and investors on their platform through the use of their own native currency, KuCoin Shares (KCS).\n\nKCS holders receive daily dividends—Kucoin will share 50% of what they make from exchange fees daily, vided among token holders according to volume.  They also enjoy discounts on trading fees themselves. Every 1000 KCS held gives the holder a 1% discount on trading fees, capped at 30%. \n\nKCS is an ERC20 token. Kucoin originally released 200 million tokens, of which 50% was sold to the public through its ICO. Kucoin does have a buy-back program wherein at least 10% of net profit is used to buy KCS every quarter in order to be destroyed until only 100 million remains. At this time of writing, KCS has a total supply of 180.3 million.",

Nuls mainnet is an open-source public blockchain with a modular architecture which makes it the most flexible in operation for the developers. Various modules are incorporated into the blockchain such as smart contracts, cross chain consensus, multichain system. The main purpose of building this blockchain was to deliver a convenient and flexible technology, easy to adopt for the developers and mainstream industries. The customizable infrastructure of Nuls blockchain improves the enterprise credibility by developing and implementing their own decentralized applications.\n\nNuls was founded by Jason Zhang, co-founded by Lily Wang and Reaper Ran. The present CEO at Nuls is Liesa Huang. The team consists of 20 other members including developers, system architects, business managers, testing engineers, community managers etc. The advisory board consists of 8 members including Ken Huang, a former Huawei blockchain expert. \n\nThe Nuls blockchain is using an innovative Proof of Credit (PoC) consensus algorithm. The working of Proof of Credit protocol is similar to Proof of Stake with a difference that there are two different kinds of nodes requirements in former one. These are agent owner and the Client. The agent owner provides the hardware, creates agent nodes lock deposit and receive commissions from clients. The clients lock the deposits, entrust agent to produce a block and pay commission to agents for producing a block. To become an agent node, the minimum requirement is to stake 20,000 Nuls. The client requires 2000 Nuls to join an agent node. The agent node is not live until he gets enough client nodes so that total amount Nuls at stake is 200,000 NULS. The agent and clients are incentivized for running the Nuls blockchain.",

It will operate on a dual token ecosystem with POWR and Sparkz blockchain layers. \n\nUsing POWR and Sparkz tokens, the energy trading platform will low homes and corporations that produce excess energy to redistribute their surplus energy to other areas for some price. It seeks to enable efficient and clean energy use around the world by co-locating energy from one point to another. Clients will be allowed to convert their POWR tokens into Sparkz tokens which they will use to purchase energy from the platform. The process will be automated, transparent and very easy to understand. \n\nAccording to the proponents of this network, a lot of energy goes to waste going through the traditional grid. It is this energy that they want to redistribute properly enabling investors and individuals to earn from their excess production and consumers to get cheap energy on the other hand. Sharing according to the developers reduces the cost of energy production and minimizes waste. Solar panel owners will be in a position to sell off their excess energy production to individuals close to them. \n\nThe platform wants to use grade meters that meet international standards and are tamper resistant to provide the most efficient services. All of these services are to be transacted using POWR and the Sparkz tokens.\n\nThe project is being led by a team of able individuals who include chair and co-founder Dr. Jemma Green, co-founder and managing director David Martin, co-founder and technical director John Bulich, global ambassador and advisor Dr. Bill Tai and chief operating officer Marc van Hoof",

It may be employed both as a means of settlement and a means of saving. Long-term value of the coin is based on its annual growth of 33.6%. In order to reduce its volatility such supply/demand regulation tools as market interventions and coin parking are used. By parking MNX in your MinexBank account, you may earn your interest with no risk of losing your money. Besides predictable increase of MNX price enables you to earn from increase in the exchange rate.\n\nThe main purpose of MinexBank is to stabilize the exchange rate within the range of no more than 5% of the previous day’s closure price. The five per cent growth owes to the practice of global stock exchanges. Once the values are reached, stock markets halt the trading, thus preventing speculators and misguided investors from dictating their own prices. Once the limit values of the five per cent range are reached, MinexBank has two options: it either changes interest rates for parking payouts, or intervenes to keep the price within the preset range. Coin parking and intervention are the basic financial instruments used by MinexBank.",

The main difference from other chains is that Quione acts as a classical non-cryptocurrency financial establishment: they were licensed by the Japanese FSA (the first cryptocurrency company in the world that received this licence), all their customers have to satisfy anti money laundering regulations and the company regularly receives financial audits from Deloitte.\n\nKey features of Qash based platform Liquid+ are World Order Book (which intends to aggregate order books from all exchanges in the world) and Prime Brokerage Services (tools to increase ROI and reduce counterparty risks).",

    "description": "Dragonchain was originally developed at Disney’s Seattle office in 2015 and 2016 as the Disney Private Blockchain Platform. Over 20 use cases and applications were explored and documented publicly via the W3C community Group. The platform was later released as open source software under the Apache 2 license in October of 2016.\n\nDragonchain simplifies the integration of real business applications on a blockchain and provides features such as easy integration, protection of business data and operations, currency agnosticism, and multi-currency support.\n\nThe Dragonchain Foundation, a Non-Profit Corporation was created in January of 2017 to maintain ownership and responsibility of the open source code.\n\nThe Dragonchain team is now in the process of launching a commercial entity to build a serverless architecture blockchain platform. The combination of serverless and blockchain technologies is unique and tremendously valuable. The timing of the Dragonchain platform launch is highly strategic to benefit from explosive growth of cloud computing over the last few years and the emerging wave of Blockchain solutions entering proof of concept stage across enterprises.\n\nThe Dragonchain team will launch Dragonchain, Inc., as a commercial entity to provide an array of products and services to the community. Our vision supports areas of the market that are underserved with strong demand and projected growth in the blockchain industry ($7.7b by 2024) across an array of multi-billion dollar sectors such as Arts, Wine, Automotive, Legal, Digital Marketing, etc. These sectors and more will experience market disruption with blockchain capabilities shifting the value proposition into decentralized environments. Dragonchain platform will support these needs.\n\nDragonchain provides a commercial platform for application developers to rapidly and securely deploy Blockchain applications while maintaining existing language development environments (e.g. Java, Python, Node, C#, Go); a tremendous costing and speed to market advantage. The Dragonchain architecture is also designed to allow nodes to handle approval of transactions based upon five levels of network consensus to provide a spectrum of trust to data consumers; a level of security and flexibility unseen in the market by current blockchain solution providers. These design attributes position Dragonchain for exponential growth.\n\nIn addition, Dragonchain will provide project incubation as well as professional services with strategic partnerships to develop successful tokenization ecosystems focusing on long term value.\n\nA DRGN is a tokenized micro-license for interaction with Dragonchain commercial platform services which captures legal guidance regarding US Securities law.",

These problems are limited performance, lack of resource segregation, and a properly working governance model. By resolving these issues, aelf will be bringing blockchain technology into business scenarios with full force.\n\nIn response to this, they have created a blockchain which can be integrated to side chain specific business scenarios. The aelf blockchain and sidechains will possess the following qualities:\n\n- High efficiency and scalability to handle transactions/applications at a commercial scale\n\n- High flexibility to customize Smart Contracts to meet the needs of different industries\n\n- High adaptability to new technology in the future\n\n- High compatibility to allow communication across public and private Chains and existing Blockchains\n\naelf was originally launched as Grid, however due to confusion with a similar project called Grid+, it was rebranded as aelf late November 2017. Another confusion which was cleared up early in aelf’s life was the complete separation from the Polkadot project.",

Htmlcoin founder, doctoral student Amando Boncales, saw the potential in cryptocurrencies and, even more so, the blockchain technology that all cryptocurrencies are built upon. He launched Htmlcoin with the firm belief that blockchain is the technology of tomorrow and harbors an important key to improving humanity’s future.\n\n​Today, Htmlcoin goes beyond functioning merely as an extremely secure form of payment. A 2017 redesign of Htmlcoin, with an eye on mass adoption, has made it more than just a crypto coin. It is now also a hybrid blockchain platform with numerous user capabilities, including the ability to serve as a communication tool, a technological tool, or an educational tool.\n\nMost importantly, Htmlcoin has been designed to be accessible to everyone, and possesses all the ingredients of a coin and blockchain platform that truly has the potential to change lives.",

    "description": "Telcoin (TEL) is an ERC-20 token developed on the Ethereum blockchain to be accepted and used by Telecom operators around the world. The total supply of Telcoin is 100 billion. The relatively large supply solves the problem of dealing with numbers after the decimal points such as 1 satoshi carried 7 zeros behind it. In most of the financial transaction, there are maximum 2 numbers after the decimal and Telcoin also will stop at 2 digits after decimal i.e. 0.00. The Telecom industry has grown into micro banks providing customers with the ability to pay using their mobile phones. Telcoin is targeting Telecom operators to use them for their financial transactions with their customers and with other operators around the world. \n\nTelcoin was founded by Claude Eguienta (CEO) and Paul Neuner (Chairman). It is owned by Telcoin Pte Ltd Singapore. The majority of the team members are from Japan. The team consists of developers, researchers, customer service, legal, account managers and marketing personals. The team consists of 9 members and 6 selected advisors.   \n\nThe purpose of Telcoin is to provide mass adoption of crypto assets by overcoming the three points of friction i.e. trust, reach and Know Your Customer compliance. By partnering with Telecom operators and distributing Telcoin through them, these issues are solved. Telcoin use cases include efficient remittances, prepaid/postpaid airtime top-up, mobile payments, international aid, roaming spending and games revenue collection/sharing.",

It is an open source project with 139 stars on GitHub.\n\nThe main purpose of creating this platform was to increase blockchain performance using node-based computing power and as well allow on-demand smart contract processing. This is achieved by multi-layered architecture: the whole blockchain is divided on MicroChains (sharding), with possible Cross-chain transactions. The stem allows to configure your own consensus algorithm for your MicroChain, including “proof of work” and “proof of stake”. On top of the GlobalMother chain event handling is built which includes transaction verification through consensus systems. The upper layer contains MicroChain smart contracts, this also enables nodes to register into mining pools. And on top of all these layers MOAC provides API to get easy access to blockchain functions and data from external software.\n\nThe main advantage of this blockchain are high transaction speed and possibility to adapt to needs of developers.",

    "description": "Zilliqa is an ERC-20 token developed on ETH blockchain aimed towards the applications requiring high throughput. Zilliqa uses their proprietary \"sharding\" technology for scaling the blockchain network while the transaction throughput increases linearly with the number of nodes on the network. Zilliqa utilizes the Proof of Work (PoW) to establishing the mining identities. This process is used for network sharding. Presently Zilliqa is a token, however, the developers are working on the platform and have released testnet 2.0, aiming for the mainnet launch in January 2019. After the mainnet launch, ERC-20 tokens will be burnt into \"Zillings\" which will be analogous to ETH on Ethereum blockchain.  \n\nThe purpose of this token is to increase the throughput of existing blockchain protocols such as Ethereum. With a network of 10,000 nodes, Zilliqa can surpass the average transactions on Visa and Mastercard with a lower fee. Although many other scaling solutions are available, what makes Zilliqa prominent is that it makes the blockchain protocol itself scaleable. The scalability protocol of Zilliqa is intrinsically integrated into network sharding, consensus protocol, and computational sharding. Some of the major uses for Zilliqa will be in gaming, entertainment, digital advertising, and streaming payment. Zilliqa has shown scaleability in high throughput applications such as automated high volume auctions, decentralized exchanges, and high-performance scientific computing. \n\nZilliqa was founded by Xinshu Dong who is a Ph.D. scientist for building secure systems. He was a technical lead for various national cybersecurity projects in Singapore. Currently, he is in the development of new public Zilliqa blockchain for high-throughput applications. Apart from X.Dong, the team consists of 6 other members expert in development, security, and research.",

The benefits of this consensus protocol include higher transaction throughput, energy efficient, horizontal scaling, no specialed hardware required and lower transaction costs. Similar to ERC-20 tokens, POA Network offers POA-20 tokens which can be interchanged on Ethereum network in a cost-effective manner using cross-chain bridge technology. The POA Network is suitable for monetization of games and offers 3 times faster solution than Ethereum at fraction of the cost. A number of Dapps are available over the blockchain such as Governance, Bridge UI, Network stats, BlockScout. Ethereum Dapps can also be ported to POA Network blockchain for efficient and low-cost operations. \n\nThe POA Network team has Igor Barinov (co-founded Block Notary) as a product manager, Viktor Baranov as core developers and Andrew Cravenho as a project lead. The team has total of 13 members. The advisory board has 5 members.\n\nThe Proof of Authority consensus protocol runs on a network of nodes known as validators. Unlike Proof of Stake where the identity of nodes is unknown and the value is given according to the number of tokens held, Proof of Authority initial nodes (validators) are Independent US public notaries with active commission license. Initially, 12 validators will be allotted the keys and further validators can be added through the voting process using builtin Governance Dapp. There is no requirement of holding a minimum amount of POA network tokens. There are several benefits of Proof of Authority consensus such as validators have a known identity, fast network (block created every 5 seconds) and legally recognizable hard forks.",

It is the first token to be developed on the TrustToken platform. The token is protected by multiple escrow accounts, with escrow agreements and whose contents must be published daily and go through monthly audits. The token is also protected from the volatility of other digital coins like BTC and ETH. All smart contracts using this token are identified via an Ethereum address.  A TrustToken is a platform on which tokens collateralized by assets in the real world are created and sold in various markets around the world.  \n\nThe main purpose of TUSD is link up real world assets with the blockchain. This token can be used as a store of value considering its stability where by investors can tokenize their physical assets and have them secured in the blockchain. The token can also be used as a means of payment as well as for money transfer. It reduces the cost and time required by conventional money transfer platforms. Another special aspect is that you can exchange fiat USD currency directly with an escrow account. \n\nTokenization is a good way of democratizing investment allowing small scale investors access to multi-billion opportunities that were previously only accessible to a few mega rich individuals and corporations. Tokenized assets can issue their own coins allowing for fractional ownership. Advantages of this system is to have liquidity premiums, access to worldwide investments and security.\n\nTUSD is available in various exchanges including Binance, Bittrex, Okcoin, OKEX, and KuCoin among others.\n\nThe team behind this project comes from renowned institutions including Google, Stamford, Palantir and UC Berkerly. The backing team includes founder Fund Angel, Stanford-StartX, Blocktower Capital, while the legal representation is from White &amp; Case and WilmerHale. \n\nNotable individuals include CEO and co-founder Danny An, CTO and co-founder Rafael Cosman and COO and co-founder Stephen Kade among others.",

It is a peer-to-peer digital network used for transferring digital assets from one person to another. It is a also a Proof-of-Work currency based on a Bitcoin fork. The coin was launched on January 3, 2018, during the Bitcoin's 9th anniversary. \n\nRavenCoin has some distinctive features that differentiates it from Bitcoin. For instance, its blocktime is one minute, has an suance schedule block reward of 5000 RVN and uses X16R mining algorithm. It is this algorithm that counters ASIC miners to prevent centralization by disrupting the hashing algorithms' ordering like is in the case with Bitcoin.  \n\nThe main purpose of this coin is to enable transfer of digital assets like tokens from one individual to another. It is good to note that this coin is free from ASICs thanks to its algorithm, had a fair launch, there was no premining and is not linked up to any exchange. Users are free to ask about prices and carry out price checks. \n\nAt the moment, the most practical use the coin can be put into is enabling instant transfer of cash from one person to another anywhere in the world.",

These applications communicate with each other, share data and are governed by smart contracts. The platform enables businesses connected here to scale up and create value by sharing data, merchants, content and customers.\n\nUsers on the platform utilize CENNZ tokens as the fuel to navigate through the system. Businesses are able to grow together by sharing information on this atform and are not required to download a lot of business applications since those available on this platform can communicate with each other. Users only need to login once and take advantage of all the applications within the platform. Furthermore, the platform allows developers to create and add more applications.\n\nThe unique or special aspect about this platform is that it not only brings apps together, it also has these apps communicating with each other. Users will use CENNZ to buy resources within the market place to create their own applications, making it bigger and growing the token's demand. Unlike other blockchain projects, Centrality already has a working platform with real world applications.\n\nCENNZ is based on the Ethereum blockchain and is thus compatible with erc20 tokens wallets. All tokens are minted by the platform. Acquiring CENNZ requires you to deposit your preferred amount of ETH, so that you can get an equivalent of the same in CENNZ. The platform plans to sell 70% of the tokens, retain 25% for development and growth, and 5% kept as reserve. Developer and founder tokens will be locked down for 2 years. \n\nCentrality is based in Auckland, New Zealand, and has offices in four other countries. Its team is made up of business people, developers and engineers. Currently, the team has about 70 business people and top-class engineers.",

It currently holds a market cap of $57.30 million at the time of writing this. It is powered by Credissimo — a European FinTech group established in 2007 that offers online consumer lending solutions.\n\nNexo positions itself as the world's first instant crypto-backed loans provider. Users are able to receive loans in fiat currency instantly by acing their crypto-assets in their Nexo Overdraft wallet. The market value of the digital assets in the wallet determines their overdraft limit (updated in real-time based on multiple exchanges). This allows the user to avoid exchange and withdrawal fees, as well as capital gain tax associated with short-term liquidation of their digital assets for fiat currency. Any market appreciation of the assets' value will not be lost to them either as these are returned upon repayment of the loan. \n\nThe core team behind Nexo includes Credissimo co-founder Kosta Kantchev, and it has Techcrunch founder Michael Arrington and Polymath CEO Trevor Koverko serving as advisors. Nexo is partnered with BitGo for crypto-asset security, and uses Onfido for KYC and AML compliance.",

    "description": "Digitex Futures is an a futures exchange platform that does not charge any fees or take any commissions for trades. The platform uses its own currency called DGTX and mints a few new tokens every year to cover the costs of transactions on its platform.\n\nSince the platform offers commission-less trades, it attracts a large number of trades to its platform. Traders must buy DGTX tokens to participate in trading raising the demand for the tokens. It is this demand that spikes the price of the kens upwards and offsets the possible inflation that would come with minting new tokens. The platform thus mints fewer new tokens. All accounts balances are secured on Ethereum's smart contracts which are decentralized and independent. \n\nUnlike many other exchanges, this platform does not require traders to entrust it with their funds. Traders have full control of their money. Token holders use decentralized governance by blockchain to issue new tokens needed for revenue generation.\n\nThe native currency for Digitex Futures is an erc223 token. It is not premined and has moderate liquidity. It is available in exchanges such as Mercatox and exrates. It is also compatible with Ethereum based coins and tokens wallets. The Initial coin Offering (ICO) for this token ended on February 2018, and raised a total of $7 million. The ICO took a record 17 minutes, where 70% of the one billion DGTX tokens were sold. \n\nDigitex Futures was founded by Adam Todd. Todd is an ex-pit-trader on (LIFFE) London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange. He is also the founder of BetTrader. He is assisted by a team of experts from various fields.",

In order to cushion IoTeX from inflation, a fixed number of IOTX tokens will be available. The supply will be capped at 10 billion coins and the coins won't be mineable. However, after the launch of the Mainnet (IoTeX), the native coin (IOX) will be mineable for a period of 50 years using the PoS consensus mechanism. The rewards of mining will reduce gradually over time.\n\nIoTeX did not hold a public sale, but there was a private sale on February 2018, that saw the project raise 25,000 ETH. All private sale investors received 20% bonus in this sale. One IOTX token was retailing at 0.0000125 ETH. There have also been community rewards in which participants have received points as the network continues to grow. The main idea is to connect the physical world block by block. \n\nIoTeX is a decentralized platform powered by privacy-centric blockchain on which developers can build their own token economies and projects. They can create flexible sub-chains and choose the programming language to use as well as make them either permissioned (private) or permissionless (public).\n\nThere are some innovations developers of this network are working on to improve its status. Fast Consensus Roll-DPoS scheme is one such innovation which will support numerous nodes with instant finality. It will have low latency and be eco-friendly. Blockchain-in-blockchain technology seeks to enhance privacy, interoperability and scalability There are some privacy-preserving schemes built within the system like light weight stealth address as well as constant size ring signature.\n\nThe IoTeX network is managed and supported by a team of experts from various fields including science, mathematics and computer science. Including Raullen Chai who is a co-founder, Qevan and JingSun, also co-founders and XinXin, who is head of cryptography among others.",

QuarkChain is developing its own blockchain which aims to solve the problem of scalability while ensuring decentralization and security. The Quarkchain network introduced blockchain sharding, aiming to facilitate transaction speeds of 100,000 TPS. The QuarkChain sharding technique is used in order to process transactions off-chain. Transaction speeds increase linearly with an increase in the number of shards. The sharded blocks are connected with Root Chain which confirms all blocks from sharded blockchains. The shards are incentivized evenly for their Hash power. QuarkChain also supports cross chain transactions.\n\nThe native crypto coin of the QuarkChain network is QKC which has initially been launched as an ERC-20 token and will be migrated to an original QuarkCoin blockchain in the future.

Whether its an ICO, a Facebook group or an exchange - it's very hard to tell where your hard earned time or money can be safely spent.\n\nThe US has a centralized organization called the Better Business Bureau (BBB) to help consumers know which companies to avoid and which to trust. This organization is far from perfect, but it serves its purpose. There is no such organization for crypto. There are a few that attempt to offer rating services for ICOs, but those are fraught with pay-to-play manipulation, and the consumer is left wondering what is real and what is paid for or fake.\n\nCrypto enthusiasts asks themselves the following types of questions and crypto projects every day:\n\n\"Is this telegram group a pump and dump group in disguise, or is it legitimate? Is this ICO a scam or a great opportunity? Are the founders who they say they are? Is their code spectacular? Is their white paper copy/pasted or original? Is this Twitter influencer REALLY stating his opinion, or was he merely paid to say that? Does this exchange have a history of hacks, or is my money safe here? Is this crypto podcast a waste of my time or does it actually offer value? Is this crypto Meetup group here in London a great group of people, or is it a sales pitch in disguise?\"\n\n$NOBS aims to be the answer to questions such as these and the solution to this major problem facing the world's newest asset class.",

After that, every half month, the benefit, after electricity cost deducted, will be divided 50:50 between the company and customers. The company will manage all other hardware and facilities and take card of all other cost. It is different from cloud mining because customer own their real graphic cards not just hashing power. Moreover,  all of founders have developer background they have invested and mainly focused on R&amp;D in order to optimize the profit not solely the size of mining farm. In term of technology, there are various of advantages, for example coin mining switching, fast GPUs deployment, customize mining hardware, and GPUs overclock profiling. \n\nThe fund from ICO will be spent to support the real requirements from customers and existing business. \n\n1. Customer don't have advance knowledge about GPUs and mining technology. Therefore, we would purchase large batch of GPUs for cheaper price and suitable mining spec.\n\n2. They would like to invest in mining, however large batch of GPUs and mining equipment could take 1-2 months to be transported. We book and prepare all of those in advance by the fund. Then, it will be ready in very short period. \n\n3. Customer would like to trade their GPUs. ZMINE will developed GPUs market which customer could bid and offer their own GPU comfortably.",

It offers a fixed 0.25% fee on all transactions and it has a dynamic transaction limit per block, allowing it to keep up with a growing number of transactions at all times. \n\nOne of the main advantages of Arionum is that it was fully written from scratch in PHP, one of the most popular programming languages in the world. While php is not as fast as c++. for example, the high number of developers that can easily understand and develop PHP and the Arionum compensates for this. \n\nThe main inspiration has been Satoshi Nakamoto's bitcoin white paper, but all the code has been thought and written by the developers to keep it's originality.\n\nArionum has been thought as a democratic and egalitarian coin, having no pre-mined coins, long mining period, no developer fees and an algorithm that advantages the average user with available CPU resources rather than mining farms.",

The system will convert BNN to the required currency automatically, then it will send the required cryptocurrency to the recipient's wallet.\n\nMore specifically, one of the most important problems presently in crypto world is that cryptocurrency traders possess a multitude of different wallet types which are limited in the types of cryptocurrencies because people require many types of cryptocurrencies for many different reasons.

The transactions fees may also vary depending on a centralized miner, with regards to bitcoin.\n\nBrokerNekoNetwork proposes solutions to these problems and saves people from complexity with its innovative and easy payment system. As a working logic, The BNN system takes its users’ orders and send their recipient to their demands from BNN main wallet.

He is also a social reward director. The team consists of four other members at the moment.\n\nThe Vitae network is based on master nodes and supernodes. Both are running on the same wallet software on a native blockchain to provide services such as coin mixing for increased privacy, decentralized governance, and instant transactions. Master nodes are incentivized for providing these services. Supernodes allow the Vitae tokens to be used at point of sale services and e-commerce solutions.

Eternal Token was developed by Atom Solutions who initially developed a non-blockchain based virtual currency known as Eternal Coin (XEC). However Eternal Coin was available only to authorized users in specific countries (Hong-Kong, South Korea, Philippines and Taiwan). For the users not residets of the above countries Eternal Token (XET) can be used to acquire Eternal Coin (XEC) in 1:10. Eternal Token is available at various exchanges around the world. The total supply of Eternal Coin and Eternal Token is 2 billion and 200 million respectively. The average block time is 15 to 17 seconds.\n\nThe purpose of Eternal token was to allow users an easy access to Eternal Coins without being the resident of aforementioned specific countries. The Eternal Coin is a centralized coin, similarly, the Eternal token is also centralized in its operations and thus solves the problem of hacking, mistakenly wrong transactions. The transactions can be canceled or reversed if needed.",

Masternodes require a Collateral of 2,400 CATO.\nThe creators of CatoCoin identified several fundamental problems with typical masternode coins that could only be addressed through the introduction of a new coin, CatoCoin. CatoCoin transforms the way in which masternode rewards and collateral requirements are calculated.\n\nConventional masternode coins pre-set rewards based on the progression of the blockchain by 'guessing' how quickly masternodes will be added over time. This means that investors ROI drops with every new masternode added, making them a less consistent, less stable long-term investment strategy.\n\nCatoCoin's NextGen Technology decouples rewards &amp; collateral requirements from the blockchain and stabilizes them to the number of network Masternodes.",

    "description": "In todays world, printed objects are used by both individuals and companies for a multitude of purposes. Individuals use our printed objects for novelty fun and special events such as birthdays, sporting events and clothing. Where companies use printed objects for merchandising, branding, and advertising.\n\nCompanies and individuals alike are always on the lookout for uniqueness, and we have just that.\n\nIn parallel, blockchain technology is currently being developed and becoming more and more used in everyday society and transactions. That's why we wanted to merge these two domains on our platform.\n\nPrintex platform allows people to design their own products with home made graphics or with pre-built designed templates and be delivered anywhere in the world.\n\nOur goal is to deliver 3 different but linked platforms :\n\n    Textile products platform (t-shirts, sweat shirts, bedding, baby's clothes...);\n\n    Goodies platform (mugs, shoes, cap, flyers...);\n\n    3D printed products platform.\n\nSince we aim at an international community, we want to allow our members to use a new crypto-currency which will secure all transactions on a decentralized currency. This will give more security and more flexibility to our clients.",

CGEN is created to generate a huge crypto-community and help new start-ups all over the world to gain audience, find investors and fund their project. CGEN can be used to trade crypto-assets with startups in a following way: we provide the start-up CGEN coin, that is already listed on exchange, and in return receive start-up tokens, which can be sold and spread among our community for discounted price and other benefits. Start-ups can quickly attract investors from CGEN-community and can immediately sell their CGEN on exchange, instead of waiting when their token is listed there. \n\nCrowdsale.Network is the first platform that support CGEN.",
